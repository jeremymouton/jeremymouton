jQuery plugin for digital currency tipping or donations (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc...). The plugin displays the payment address, and generates a QR code which users can scan to make the transaction from their smartphone.

This project has a sister repository – [cointipper-server](https://github.com/jeremymouton/cointipper-server) – a Sinatra (Ruby) backend for hosted donation buttons.
